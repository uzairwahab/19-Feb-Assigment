Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?
ANS. Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework 
that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.
It does have many cool features like url routing, template engine. It is a WSGI web app framework.

Advantages of Flask
.Scalable. Size is everything, and Flask's status as a microframework means that you can use it to grow a tech project such as a web app incredibly quickly. ...
.Flexible. ...
.Easy to negotiate. ...
.Lightweight. ...
.Documentation. ...
.Not a lot of tools. ...
.Difficult to get familiar with a larger Flask app. ...
.Maintenance costs.


Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in
Jupyter Notebook.
ANS. 
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/hello_world1")
def hello_world1():
    return "<h1>Hello, World!1</h1>"




Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?
ans. App Routing means mapping the URLs to a specific function that will handle the logic for that URL. Modern web frameworks use more meaningful URLs to help 
users remember the URLs and make navigation simpler.
Example: In our application, the URL (“/”) is associated with the root URL.

app = Flask(__name__) 
@app.route('/test3')  #thsi is app route and this how do we use 
def test3():
    l = [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]
    return 'thi is my first list is flask app {}'.format(l[5])



Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/”
route to show the following details:
Company Name: ABC Corporation
Location: India
Contact Detail: 999-999-9999
Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.
ANS. @app.route('/welcome')
def welcome_msg():
    return 'welcome to abc corporation '

@app.route('/')
def details():
    return 'Company Name: ABC Corporation<br>Location: India<br>Contact Detail: 999-999-9999'




Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the
url_for() function.
ans. @app.route('/home')
def home():
    return 'this is my first function '
    with app.test_request_context():
        print(url_for('login'))
